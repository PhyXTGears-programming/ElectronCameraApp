# First Robotics Competition Camera Dashboard

A dedicated browser-based app for viewing the camera feed from the WPIlib Camera Server on the RoboRIO.

Most settings are currently hard-coded.

- Fixed IP address.
- Fixed position and size (1080p widescreen monitor preferred).
- HUD crosshairs with color inversion to improve visibility.


# TODO

- [ ] Add user setting for team number. Use to generate hostname (roboRIO-xxxx-FRC.local) or IP address (10.xx.xx.2).
- [ ] Add user control to save position and size of app.
- [ ] Load and restore save position and size from config file.

# Acknowledgements

This app wouldn't be possible without the gracious professionalism exhibited by
a fellow team at the Indiana Tippecanoe event.  While struggling with latency
in the LabView dashboard, this team advised us to use the web browser instead.
That contribution evolved into the app provided here.

Sadly, we cannot remember which team sparked this effort with their
contribution, and hope to run into them again, and give them the credit they
deserve.
